## React Application
## Updating to New Releases
I had proplem with the latest version react when I pass methods or function as props of another component.
## Folder Structure
After creation, your project should look like this:
```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    AddParticipant.js
    index.css
    index.js
    Participant.js
    Participants.js
    TitleBar.js

```
For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
